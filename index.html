        <h1>Student Prerequisite Analyzer</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Student Prerequisite Analyzer!</p>
        <p>My name is Richard Gentry, and I am a professor in the Mechanical-Electrical Technology Department at Sacramento City College. I created this app to simplify my own tasks as a faculty member, and I hope it can make your work easier too. The Student Prerequisite Analyzer automates the process of checking student prerequisites, providing you with clear and organized data. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:gentryr@scc.losrios.edu">gentryr@scc.losrios.edu</a>. Enjoy using the app!</p>
        <p>This tool is designed to make your life as an instructor easier by simplifying the process of checking course prerequisites. If you've ever struggled with organizing and tracking which students have completed specific courses, this app is here to help. Just follow the steps below to fetch your roster data, paste it into the text box, and hit submit. The Student Prerequisite Analyzer will analyze and present the data in a clear, easy-to-read format. You'll be able to quickly identify which students are ready to proceed and which ones still need to complete prerequisites. Let's get started!</p>
